### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total:

1. A landing page containing:

  - An explanation of the project

  - Links to each visualizations page 

  - A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization

2. Four visualization pages:

  - A descriptive title and heading tag

  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison

  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance

3. A "Comparisons" page that:

  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them

  - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations

  - The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens

4. A "Data" page that:

  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations

  - The table must be a bootstrap table component

- The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

  - Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page

  - Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page

  - Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page

  - Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change)
